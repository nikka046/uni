# Todo
 - (1) prepare for interview

## Smart Home
 - using the raspberry pi camera, detect whether someone is in the room
 - whenever someone enters the room, record the clip. clips will be saved locally and allowed to be played back, but older ones will be deleted when running out of space
 - allow to setup triggers for when someone enters the room, leaves it, etc
 - bind it with the nfc tags.
 - allow for manual start/stop recording
 - add a speaker and allow to talk to the raspberry
 - connect raspberry pi with relays and the rgb strip
 - allow recording audio

## Forced workout project
 - detect if someone is in the room. If yes, randomly buzz buzzer or flash lights, telling me to do as many push ups as possible
