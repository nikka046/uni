# Daily Structure

In order to organise my day as well as possible, I need to limit doing some tasks to specific places, so that I can stay focused on doing one at once.
 - on the bus
   - listen to podcasts
   - watch youtube videos
 - at home
   - anything but youtube videos
   - music
   - games
 - at uni
   - only do work
   - music allowed, but only for concentration
 - while shopping
   - music / podcasts

## Rules for organising time
 - don't leave uni until you have completed all your work
 - go shopping on your way back from uni
