    We live in a world where the largest companies store gigabytes of data about each one of their users. This comes with many potential issues investigated in this report, regarding how the data will be stored, who will have access to the data, how they will be able to access it, and how much of it they will be able to see. This report details the risks associated with storing the data in a cloud and how they can be minimised, including technical implementations as well as appropriate training the staff need to go through in order to keep the data secure. There are also many legal and ethical issues associated with storing users' sensitive data that have been outlined, especially their personal medical/health information. Lastly, this report explains all of the adequate Data Protection Act rules that the company must follow and outlines recommended method as to how to implement them securely.
